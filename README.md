# Strategic Workforce Analytics: Orion Data Systems
### Relational Database Architecture & Human Capital Insights

## Project Overview & Business Value
Orion Data Systems, a multinational tech firm, required a deep-dive analysis of their global workforce. As a Junior Data Analyst, I transitioned their raw database into a strategic roadmap to optimize payroll, identify recruitment gaps, and benchmark international operational costs.
 - Objective: Solve critical HR questions regarding salary equity and departmental staffing.
 - Impact: Delivered a framework for 2026 budget planning and identified immediate hiring needs in unassigned roles.

 ## Technical Methodology (The Deep-Dive)
 To ensure data integrity and complex relationship mapping, I engineered a SQL script utilizing advanced relational logic:
 - Relational Joins: Implemented INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN to unify Employees, Departments, and Countries.
 - Logic Aggregation: Used GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to isolate high-performing departments.
 - Dynamic Classification: Developed a CASE statement to categorize 3,900+ records into distinct Salary Bands (Low, Medium, High).
 - Subqueries & CTEs: Created Common Table Expressions to filter "High Earners"—those outperforming the company-wide average salary.

## Data-Driven Insights
  ### Organizational Structure
 - Highest Headcount: Identified the dominant departments to assist in resource allocation.
 - The Vacancy Gap: Using IS NULL logic, I discovered active job titles with zero assigned staff, representing a critical bottleneck in departmental productivity.
  ### Compensation & Equity
 - Salary Distribution: The majority of the workforce sits in the Medium Band ($5k - $10k), providing a stable middle-management core.
 - Regional Costs: Mapped total salary expenditure by country, highlighting that [Region X] holds the highest operational overhead.

## Proposed Growth Initiatives (Recommendations)
 - Targeted Hiring: Immediate activation of recruitment for the identified "Workforce Gaps."
- Budget Optimization: Reallocate 10% of the overhead from high-cost regions to support growth in emerging markets.
 - Talent Retention: Review the "Low Salary Band" against industry standards to prevent turnover in entry-level specialized roles.
